# Complaint Tracker System

The Complaint Tracker System is a mobile and web application that will facilitate communication between
the municipality and citizens. The system will provide citizens with the ability to register and then they can
send their complaint to the municipality and view their complaint status about their services. The main aim
of the system is to maximize citizen satisfaction, resolve citizen complaint and increase the service delivery
quality. (https://github.com/Tshianeo28/COS730/files/4743054/user.manual.pdf)
